	<h1>Project Readme</h1>
	<p>This project provides a basic structure for a web application that can be extended to meet the specific needs of any project. The application is divided into two modules, Admin and User, and includes a basic UI theme along with simple login and signup screens to provide a starting point for your project.</p>
	<p>The application is built using .NET Core and the UI is created using pure HTML and CSS. With this structure, you have the flexibility to add new features and modules as your project evolves.</p>
